        <h2>Information about Green Energy</h2>

        <p>Green energy refers to energy that is produced using environmentally friendly methods and sources. It is also known as renewable energy because it comes from resources that are naturally replenished.</p>

        <h3>Types of Green Energy Sources:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solar Energy:</strong> Captures energy from the sun using photovoltaic cells or solar panels.</li>
            <li><strong>Wind Energy:</strong> Harnesses the power of the wind to generate electricity through wind turbines.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydropower:</strong> Generates electricity by capturing the energy of flowing water, typically through dams or water turbines.</li>
            <li><strong>Biomass:</strong> Uses organic materials, such as plants and waste, to produce energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Geothermal Energy:</strong> Taps into the Earth's internal heat to generate electricity or provide heating.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advantages of Green Energy:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions</li>
            <li>Promotes Sustainable and Clean Energy</li>
            <li>Decreases Dependence on Fossil Fuels</li>
            <li>Creates Job Opportunities in the Renewable Energy Sector</li>
            <li>Minimizes Environmental Impact</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">Are there Cons?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer" id="answer3">
            <ul>
            <li>Solar & Wind depend on Weather Condtions</li>
            <li>Batteries used to store green energy may have limitations in terms of capacity, efficiency, and environmental impact. </li>
            <li>High Initial Cost</li>
            <li>Solar & Wind Farms require Significant Land Areas (Habitat Disruption)</li>
            <li>Lower Energy Density Compared to Fossil Fuel, This means that more land or equipment may be required to generate the same amount of energy.</li>
        </ul>
